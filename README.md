## Retrospect from 2023

I wrote this mainly in 2019. It's June 2023 as of this writing. I have not maintained 
or updated this project. I'm not sure if I would choose similar architecture today, but it looks like I wrote this using idiomatic React/Redux of the day. 

As it stands currently, I am no longer able to install
this project on my local machine for development purposes. Nor can I build/deploy it. That may
be because I have up-to-date Node. The build appears
to error out on building node-sass, and that seems
to have something to do with my local Python. Obviously
it built at the time I originally developed it. 

The project looks like it would work if I ported it over to a new
platform. I **have not decided if I want to do that.**
