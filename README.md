#  Drop

Drop is a React app for storing small bits of text information tagged with
\#hashtags.  This data can later be searched using the \#hashtags.

This project is **not maintained**. It is
deprecated in favor of Drop-React-2: https://github.com/xerocross/drop-react-2.
Drop-React-2 is rebuilt on modern platforms as of 2023.

## Retrospect from 2023

I wrote this mainly in 2019. It's June 2023 as of this writing. I have not maintained 
or updated this project. I'm not sure if I would choose similar architecture today, 
but it looks like I wrote this using idiomatic React/Redux of the day. 

As it stands currently, I am no longer able to install
this project on my local machine for development purposes. Nor can I build/deploy it. That may
be because I have up-to-date Node. The build appears
to error out on building node-sass, and that seems
to have something to do with my local Python. Obviously
it built at the time I originally developed it.

Please see Drop-React-2 for a working port in 2023.
